### Hello there, This is the repository for the website made for Communications Lab 30MFF video! 

Here's a brief documentation on how the process of creating the website went ✨ --->

Project Name: Money: What connects us together?
Project Description: The main concept of the website was to showcase the film my group had made for the 30MFF in class. The theme of the film was money and thus, in
this website, I try to incorporate different things to communicate this concept of the film. 

I wanted to go for a very minimalistic theme in terms of colors and add in splashes of color when needed and chose yellow as the color that would feature on the website
 in addition to black and white. I chose yellow not only because of how bright it is but also because it related to gold coins and money, which is the theme of the website.
 
I want this website to communicate the love and dependence the society has on money, while a lot of the text and the images may seem exaggerated, money does play a huge role in
 the way we make decisions,think, and do work. The film puts out that notion and I want my website to be an extension to the medium of film and further communicate this idea.
 
In terms of incorporating the elements of money, I have the following on my website:
1. Gold circular buttons depicting gold coins for navigation bars
2. The color yellow to depict money
3. A banner with MONEY! written on it to depict the offer/sale/discounts at shops, depicting lifestyle focussed on money✨
4. Shakesperean-like poetry created by me to sing of money
5. Bios of actors focussing on their relation with money
6. Photos of the actors with money

Process: Creating a wireframe for the website as a homework for class helped a lot in designing the website. it served as a guide for design decisions and layout. While it is not a 100% 
the same as the wireframe, I think it served as a great medium for me to speed up the process of decision making.

I started off with basic HTML code and created and linked all the pages I wanted for the website. After that, I added CSS to style the elements, and this is where it got a bit messy.
I couldn't keep track of all the style elements but the Developers Tool helped me in debugging that. Finally, after I decided on the element of interactivity, which was a slideshow of the actors 
in the film, i made a JavaScript file as well. This part was a huge learning curve for me as I've never done JS before and the syntax was so confusing but eventually, I got a hang of it. Using the 
consele.log() feature helped a lot in debugging the code here and the Console in general, since it showed errors when files weren't linked properly. 

Reflection/Evaluation: The website is very close to what I had in mind initially. However, I think the changes were for the good. for example, in my initial idea, I wanted to put in shapes that depicted money on the cast page.
But when I started coding, I realised that it looked too crowded and it felt like a lot of things were happening on the website. Similarly, in addition to the marquee banner on top, I wanted to work on more
movement in the website, but after experimenting, I've realized that it can be too much if we go overboard with the animations. So, I decided to stick with just the movement of the money banner. 

What I've learnt from this process is that ideas may not go exactly as planned and so contuniously looking at how the ideas present in a website  is important, as a lot of the things I imagined in my mind did not look as good as 
I pictured it in my head. This was a huge learning curve for me especially with JavaScript. I've used HTML before and combining CSS with that was a fun yet long process.
